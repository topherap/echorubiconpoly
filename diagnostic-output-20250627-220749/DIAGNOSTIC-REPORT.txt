ECHO RUBICON REFRESH ISSUE - COMPREHENSIVE DIAGNOSTIC REPORT
==========================================================
Generated: 06/27/2025 22:07:49

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
1. DUPLICATE FUNCTIONS: Two checkAuthenticationStatus functions found
   - First at line ~784
   - Second at line ~1057
   - JavaScript will use the SECOND (last) definition

2. BEFOREUNLOAD HANDLER: Found in preload.js line 346
   - May interfere with page refresh

3. MENU CONFIGURATION: No reload menu item in main.js

4. MOUNT EFFECT: Found at line ~1229
   - Calls checkAuthenticationStatus on component mount

HYPOTHESIS:
The second checkAuthenticationStatus function (line 1057) is missing
the session persistence check, causing the app to re-authenticate on every refresh.

RECOMMENDED FIXES:
1. Delete the second checkAuthenticationStatus function
2. Comment out the beforeunload handler in preload.js
3. Add reload menu item to main.js
4. Clear localStorage and test

- checkAuthenticationStatus-SECOND.js (problematic version)
