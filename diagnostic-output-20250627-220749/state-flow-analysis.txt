AUTHENTICATION STATE FLOW ANALYSIS
==================================

1. Component Mount
   └─> useEffect with [] dependencies (line ?)
       └─> Calls checkAuthenticationStatus()
           └─> Which version? (First at 784 or Second at 1057?)

2. checkAuthenticationStatus Logic:
   First Version (line 784):
   - Checks localStorage
   - Has session persistence logic
   
   Second Version (line 1057):
   - Different implementation?
   - Missing session check?

3. Potential Issues:
   - JavaScript uses the LAST defined function
   - Second definition overwrites the first
   - Mount effect might call wrong version
