This is a **world-bearing ritual**.\n\n> The squat is a **descent into memory**, and a **rise into sovereignty**.\n\n\n## 🜂 Warmup Sets (Uncounted)\n\n- **Bar = spine = pillar**  \n- Inhale as you descend. Exhale as you rise.  \n- Use each set to **locate breath in the hips**.\n\n- **Breath mantra**:  \n  - Inhale: *“Enter the deep.”*  \n  - Exhale: *“Anchor the crown.”*\n\n\n\n## 🜃 Closing Ritual\n\n- Step out of the rack.  \n- **Hands on ribs. Feet flat. Eyes closed.**  \n- Three deep breaths into the **pelvis**.  \n- No talking for 60 seconds.\n\n\n\n**This is not exercise.  \nThis is bearing the world into being.**  \n**The legs are just the altar.**\n\n---\n**Viewing:** Temple squats\nYou can now ask questions about this content.\n"

      "content": "📄 Discussing: Temple squats\n\nI appreciate your enthusiasm for the Temple squats ritual and your focus on world-bearing intention. Your description of the ritual provides a clear setup and intention, as well as guidance for warming up and closing the exercise. It's great to see how you're using this ritual as a means to explore self-discovery and inner growth.\n\nYour summary of the Temple squats content accurately reflects the details provided in your vault entry, such as the Primary Sefirah (Yesod), Secondary Overlay (Malkuth), Element (Earth), and Mantra (\"I carry the temple. I am the root.\"). The ritual is intended to be both a descent into memory and a rise into sovereignty through squatting, which symbolizes the connection between the physical body and the spiritual essence within us.\n\nYour approach to warming up sets and breath work seems thoughtful and effective for preparing your hips to locate your breath during the exercise. Your closing ritual of standing tall, hands on ribs, feet flat, and three deep breaths into the pelvis emphasizes relaxation and mindfulness in completing the exercise. The instructions provided effectively guide participants through the experience while maintaining a spiritually focused intention.\n\nMoving forward, I'd be happy to discuss any questions or concerns you may have about the content, as well as provide further insights or suggestions for making the most of your Temple squats ritual."
